title: "lazyNumbers: exact floating-point arithmetic"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

It is well-known that floating-point arithmetic is inexact even with some 
simple operations. For example:

```{r}
1 - 7 * 0.1 == 0.3
```

This package provides the *lazy numbers*, which allow exact floating-point 
arithmetic:

```{r}
library(lazyNumbers)
x <- lazynb(1) - lazynb(7) * lazynb(0.1)
as.double(x) == 0.3
```
