# lazyNumbers 1.2.0

* It is now possible to deal with missing values in lazy vectors and lazy matrices.

* The function `asDouble` has been removed since its `prec` argument caused no difference.

* The summary functions `min`, `max`, `range`, `sum` and `prod` gain the `na.rm` argument.

* New functions `diag` and `diag<-`.
