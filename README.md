It is well-known that floating-point arithmetic is inexact even with
some simple operations. For example:

``` r
1 - 7 * 0.1 == 0.3
## [1] FALSE
```

This package provides the *lazy numbers*, which allow exact
floating-point arithmetic:

``` r
library(lazyNumbers)
x <- lazynb(1) - lazynb(7) * lazynb(0.1)
as.double(x) == 0.3
## [1] TRUE
```
